Hello, I'm Morufat Kajogbola Lamidi, a frontend developer with a passion for learning. I'm embarking on the software development journey with #3MTT Nigeria to enhance my skills as a developer. Join me as I document my journey and work towards achieving my dream!

# Overview

This repository contains all my studies and learning documentation for my 3mtt Hybrid program(physical and online)

## Weekly Log

 I'll be organizing my weekly study sessions into folders categorized by each week of the modules. Each folder will contain my notes, exercises, and any projects I work on for that day. This structured approach will help me stay organized and track my progress throughout the 3MTT Program

 Additionally, I'll be updating my progress daily on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morufat-lamidi/), where I'll share insights, code snippets, project updates, and reflections on my learning journey with the hashtag #3MTTSoftwareDevelopment.
